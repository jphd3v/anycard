## Overview

Four-player Marjapussi using a 36-card deck, based on [rules on Pagat.com](https://www.pagat.com/marriage/marjapussi.html). Players form partnerships (P1+P3 vs P2+P4). The goal is to be the first team to reach **12 game points**. Points are earned by winning tricks and declaring marriages (King and Queen of the same suit).

## Setup

- **Deck**: 36-card deck (6, 7, 8, 9, J, Q, K, 10, A).
- **Ranking**: A 10 K Q J 9 8 7 6 (Aces and 10s are high).
- **Players**: 4 players in fixed partnerships: **P1 & P3 vs P2 & P4**.
- **Dealing**: 9 cards are dealt to each player.
- **Starting Player**: The player to the left of the dealer leads the first trick.

## Turn Structure

### Phase 1: Leading and Declarations

The player who leads a trick (the winner of the previous trick, or the leader of the first trick) can declare a marriage **before** playing their card.

- To declare, you must hold both the King and Queen of a suit.
- A marriage can also be declared if your _partner_ holds the King and Queen, but only on your turn to lead.
- The **first marriage** declared in a hand sets the trump suit and is worth **40 points**.
- **Subsequent marriages** change the trump suit to that suit and are worth **20 points**.
- You cannot declare a marriage if your team is currently "in the bag" (pussissa).

### Phase 2: Trick Play

1. **Leading**: The current player leads any card.
2. **Following suit**: Players must follow suit if possible.
3. **Trump play**: If a player is void in the led suit, they **must** play a trump if they have one.
4. **Winning**: The highest trump wins. If no trumps are played, the highest card of the led suit wins.
5. **No Overtake**: There is no requirement to play a higher card than what is currently on the table.

## Scoring

### Card Points (Per Hand)

- **A**: 11 points
- **10**: 10 points
- **K**: 4 points
- **Q**: 3 points
- **J**: 2 points
- **9, 8, 7, 6**: 0 points
- **Last Trick**: 10 points
- **Total Card Points**: 120 points available in tricks.

### Game Points

At the end of a hand, card points and marriage points are totaled:

- **1 Game Point**: Awarded to the team that reaches 100 or more points, OR to the team with more points if neither (or both) reached 100.
- **2 Game Points**: Awarded instead of 1 if the losing team has fewer than 20 points.
- **Tie**: If both teams have exactly the same total points, no game points are awarded.
- **The Bag (Pussi)**: If a team wins **zero tricks**, they are "in the bag". While in the bag, they cannot score game points or declare marriages. They only get out of the bag by winning at least one trick in a subsequent hand.

### Victory Condition

- **Target**: The first partnership to reach **12 game points** wins.

## Game Strategy

- **Trump Management**: Declaring a new marriage changes the trump suit. Use this to neutralize an opponent's strong trump hand.
- **The 100 Point Race**: Since game points are often decided by reaching 100, tracking marriage points and high cards (Aces/10s) is crucial.
- **Avoiding the Bag**: If your hand is weak, focus on winning at least one trick to avoid the penalty of being in the bag.
