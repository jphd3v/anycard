## Overview

Finnish-style Casino (**Kasino**) for 2 players using a standard 52-card deck, based on [rules on Pagat.com](https://www.pagat.com/fishing/nordic_casino.html#finland). Players capture table cards whose values match or sum to the card played. Clearing the table earns a bonus point (**mökki**). The game is a race to 16 points.

## Setup

- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck.
- **Players**: 2 players.
- **Dealing**: 4 cards are dealt to each player, and 4 face-up cards are dealt to the table for the first deal of the hand.
- **Re-dealing**: When hands are empty, another 4 cards are dealt to each player (no new cards to the table) until the deck is exhausted.

## Capture Values

Cards have different values depending on whether they are on the table or played from the hand:

| Card                   | Value on Table | Value from Hand |
| :--------------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| **Ace**                | 1              | **14**          |
| **10♦️ (Big Kasino)**  | 10             | **16**          |
| **2♠️ (Small Kasino)** | 2              | **15**          |
| **King**               | 13             | 13              |
| **Queen**              | 12             | 12              |
| **Jack**               | 11             | 11              |
| **10 - 3**             | Face value     | Face value      |

_Note: Because an Ace from hand is 14 and an Ace on the table is 1, you cannot capture a single Ace with another Ace._

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of playing exactly one card from the hand.

### 1. Card Play

The player plays a card from their hand. They can choose to **Capture** or **Trail**.

### 2. Capture (Optional)

A played card can capture any number of cards or sets of cards from the table that match its **Hand Value**.

- **Rank Match**: Capture a card of the same table value (e.g., a King takes a King).
- **Sum Match**: Capture a set of cards that sum to the hand value (e.g., a 10 takes a 7 and a 3).
- **Multiple Captures**: You can capture multiple cards and sets in a single turn if they all individually match or sum to your played card's value.

**Capture Optimization**: If multiple combinations are possible, the game automatically selects the one that yields the **highest number of cards** (to help win the Most Cards point). If there is a tie, it prioritizes cards with higher point values (Aces, Kasinos, and Spades).

_Captures are not mandatory; you may choose to trail even if a capture is possible._

### 3. Trail

If no capture is made, the played card is placed face-up on the table and becomes available for future captures.

## Scoring

Points are awarded both immediately and at the end of the hand. The first player to reach **16 points** wins.

### Immediate Points

These points are awarded the moment the card is captured:

- **Each Ace**: 1 point.
- **10♦️ (Big Kasino)**: 2 points.
- **2♠️ (Small Kasino)**: 1 point.
- **Mökki (Sweep)**: 1 point for clearing the entire table.
  - _Mökkis cancel out_: If both players get at least one mökki during a hand, they cancel each other and no sweep points are awarded.
  - _Restrictions_: No mökki points are awarded during the last deal of a hand, or if a player has 10 or more points at the start of the deal.

### End of Hand Points

These are tallied after all cards have been played:

- **Most cards**: 1 point (0 if tied).
- **Most spades**: 2 points (0 if tied).

### Last Capture

There is no extra point for the last capture. However, any cards remaining on the table after the final turn are collected by the player who made the last capture of the hand.

## Winning

The game ends immediately when a player reaches 16 points. If multiple players reach 16 in the same turn, the one with the higher score wins. If scores are equal, the game continues with another hand.

## Game Strategy

- **The Big & Small Kasinos**: The 10♦️ (16) and 2♠️ (15) are your most powerful tools. Because their hand values are so high, they can often capture multiple sets of cards at once (e.g., a 10♦️ taking an 8+8, or a 9+7, or a 10+6).
- **Ace Flexibility**: While an Ace is worth 14 from your hand, it is only worth 1 on the table. You cannot use an Ace to take an Ace, so try to use your Ace to capture other combinations (like a 9 and a 5) to keep your Aces out of the opponent's reach.
- **Mökki Management**: Since mökkis cancel each other out, if your opponent has already cleared the table, you should prioritize getting a mökki of your own to "nullify" their bonus point.
- **The 10-Point Threshold**: Be aware that once you reach 10 points, you can no longer earn points from mökkis. At this stage, focus entirely on capturing Aces, the Kasinos, and securing the majority of Spades and cards.
- **End-Game Counting**: In the final deal, try to ensure you make the last capture. Even if it's a small pairing, it allows you to sweep up all remaining table cards, which often decides the "Most Cards" or "Most Spades" points.
