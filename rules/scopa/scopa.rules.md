# Scopa Rules

## Overview

Scopa is a classic Italian fishing game for 2 players, based on [rules on Pagat.com](https://www.pagat.com/fishing/scopa.html). Players capture table cards by matching their rank or by combining them to sum to the value of the played card. Clearing the table earns a **Scopa**.

## Setup

- **Deck**: 40-card deck (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, J, Q, K in each suit).
- **Ranking**: Numerical values for capture: King (10), Queen (9), Jack (8), 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace (1).
- **Suit names**: Clubs ♣️ (Bastoni), Diamonds ♦️ (Denari), Hearts ♥️ (Coppe), Spades ♠️ (Spade).
- **Dealing**: 3 cards are dealt to each player and 4 face-up cards are dealt to the table initially.
  - **Initial Table Rule**: If the four initial face-up cards include **three or four Kings**, the hand is void. The cards are gathered, re-shuffled, and dealt again automatically.
- **Re-dealing**: When both hands are empty, 3 more cards are dealt to each player from the deck until the deck is exhausted. No new cards are dealt to the table during re-deals.

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of playing exactly one card from the hand.

### 1. Card Play

The player plays a card from their hand. They can choose to **Capture** or **Trail**.

### 2. Capture (Mandatory if possible)

A played card can capture cards from the table based on these priority rules:

- **Rank Match**: If there is at least one card on the table with the same rank as the card played, you MUST capture it. If there are multiple, the system automatically picks one for you.
- **Sum Match**: If no card of the same rank exists, but there are combinations of cards that sum to the played card's value, you MUST capture one such combination.

**Capture Optimization**: If multiple combinations are possible, the game automatically selects the one that yields the **highest number of cards** (to help win the Cards point). If there is a tie, it chooses the combination with the highest total value.

**Note**: In Scopa, you must play to your **Won Pile** to capture and to the **Table** to trail. If a capture is possible, you are not allowed to trail.

### 3. Trail

If no capture is possible with the played card, it is placed face-up on the table (Trailing).

## Scopa (Sweep)

A **Scopa** is awarded when a player captures all remaining cards on the table, leaving it empty.

- Each Scopa earns **1 game point**.
- **Important**: A Scopa is not awarded for the very last trick of the hand.

## Scoring

At the end of the hand, points are awarded in five categories:

### 1. Cards

The player who captured the **most total cards** earns **1 point** (0 points on a tie).

### 2. Coins (Diamonds)

The player who captured the **most cards of the Diamonds suit** (Denari) earns **1 point** (0 points on a tie).

### 3. Settebello

The player who captured the **7 of Diamonds** earns **1 point**.

### 4. Primiera

The player with the best Primiera earns **1 point** (0 on a tie). Primiera is calculated by taking the highest-value card captured in each of the four suits and summing their Primiera points:

- **7**: 21 points
- **6**: 18 points
- **Ace**: 16 points
- **5**: 15 points
- **4**: 14 points
- **3**: 13 points
- **2**: 12 points
- **J, Q, K**: 10 points each

### 5. Scopas

Each Scopa earned during play is worth **1 point**.

## End of Hand

- When the deck and both hands are empty, any cards remaining on the table are given to the **last player who made a capture**.
- The player with the highest total score wins the hand.
- If total scores are tied, the hand is considered a draw.

## Game Strategy

- **Protect the 7 of Diamonds**: It is the most valuable single card in the game.
- **Track the Table**: Try to avoid leaving combinations that sum to 8, 9, or 10, as face cards can easily sweep them.
- **Last Capture**: Remember that the last person to make a capture takes all remaining table cards, which can be crucial for the "Cards" and "Coins" points.
- **Scopa Management**: If your opponent has already cleared the table, you should prioritize getting a Scopa of your own to keep pace.
