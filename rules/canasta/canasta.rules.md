## Overview

Classic Canasta is a four-player partnership game played with two standard 52-card decks plus four jokers (108 cards total). It follows the [classic rules on Pagat.com](https://www.pagat.com/rummy/canasta.html#classic). Partnerships are fixed for the whole game (**Player 1 & Player 3 vs Player 2 & Player 4**). Scoring is based on building melds of the same rank, completing canastas (melds of 7+ cards), and going out to end the hand.

## Components and Terms

- **Stock**: face-down draw pile.
- **Discard pile**: face-up pile where the turn-ending discard goes.
- **Meld**: three or more cards of the same rank laid on the table for a partnership.
- **Canasta**: a meld of seven or more cards.
- **Wild cards**: jokers and twos can substitute for any rank.

## Setup

- **Deal**: 11 cards are dealt to each player, clockwise.
- **Red threes**: Any red three (3♦️, 3♥️) is placed face-up for the partnership and replaced immediately from the stock until no red threes remain in hand.
- **Start the discard pile**: Cards are flipped from the stock to the discard pile until the top card is neither a wild card nor a red three. (Wilds or red threes remain in the pile; the top card is the first playable discard.)

## Turn Sequence

Each turn has two phases.

### 1) Draw Phase (exactly one option)

- **Draw from the stock** (the top card is taken), or
- **Take the discard pile** (see rules below).

### 2) Meld and Discard Phase

- **Meld**: New melds are created or cards are added to existing partnership melds.
- **End the turn**: One card is discarded to the discard pile.

Going out may occur by discarding the last card or by melding the final card (if the going-out requirements are met).

## Taking the Discard Pile

- The **entire** discard pile is taken into the hand, but the **top discard** must be melded immediately.
- **Frozen pile**: A pile is frozen for a partnership if it contains a wild card or a red three, or if the partnership has not yet made any melds.
  - If the pile is frozen, **two natural cards** of the top discard’s rank must be held to take it.
  - If the pile is not frozen, it may be taken if:
    - the top card can be added to an existing partnership meld of that rank, or
    - a new meld can be formed using the top card plus two matching cards from the hand (or one matching card plus a wild).

## Melding Rules

### Basic Melds

- **Minimum size**: 3 cards of the same rank.
- **Natural cards**: At least 2 natural (non-wild) cards are required in any meld.
- **Wild limit**: At most 3 wild cards are permitted in a single meld.
- **No all-wild melds**: A meld cannot be made entirely of wilds.

### Canastas

- **Natural canasta**: no wild cards (bonus +500).
- **Mixed canasta**: contains wild cards (bonus +300). A mixed canasta is typically marked with a sideways wild card.

## Special Threes

### Red Threes (3♦️, 3♥️)

- Set aside immediately when drawn or dealt and replaced from the stock.
- **Scoring**: +100 each if the partnership has made at least one meld in the hand; otherwise −100 each. A bonus +400 applies if the partnership has all four red threes.

### Black Threes (3♣️, 3♠️)

- Cannot be melded during normal play.
- May be melded only when going out, as a special set of 3 or 4 black threes.
- Discarding a black three blocks the next player from taking the discard pile until it is covered by another discard.

## Going Out (Ending the Hand)

Going out is permitted only if:

1. The partnership has completed at least one canasta, and
2. The hand is emptied by discarding or by melding the final card.

If the partnership has no canasta, the last card is not allowed to be melded; a card must be retained for the final discard.

## Scoring

Scoring happens when the hand ends. The hand score is:

**(Points in the partnership’s melds and bonuses) − (Points remaining in the hand)**.

### Card Values

- **Joker**: 50
- **Ace, Two**: 20 each
- **King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8**: 10 each
- **7, 6, 5, 4**: 5 each
- **Black three**: 5 each (only meldable when going out)
- **Red three**: 100 each (if counted; see above)

### Bonuses and Requirements

- **Going out**: +100 (+200 if going out concealed, without previously laying down melds).
- **Canasta bonus**: Natural +500, Mixed +300.
- **Initial meld requirement**: The first meld for a partnership must meet a minimum point total based on the partnership’s cumulative score:
  - Below 0: 15
  - 0–1495: 50
  - 1500–2995: 90
  - 3000+: 120

## End of the Stock

If the stock runs out, the hand ends when the current player cannot legally take the discard pile. If the player can take it, the pile must be taken.

## Game Strategy

- **Never discard wild cards** (Jokers, 2s) unless you are going out—they are too valuable for building melds and canastas.
- **Watch opponent melds** before discarding—avoid giving them cards they can use. E.g. if opponents have melded Aces, don't discard an Ace.
- **Use black threes defensively**—discarding a black three (3♣, 3♠) blocks the next player from taking the pile.
- **Build toward canastas**—you need at least one canasta (7+ cards) to go out, so prioritize growing your melds.
