## Overview

Two-player Ristiseiska using a standard 52-card deck, based on [rules on Finnish Wikipedia](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ristiseiska). Players compete to build sequential runs in each suit, starting with the 7 of clubs ♣️. The game emphasizes strategic card placement and sequence building, with the winner being the first to play all cards from their hand.

## Setup

- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck.
- **Ranking**: Sequences build from 7 up to King and down to 2. Ace is the final card played to close a suit.
- **Players**: 2 players (P1 and P2).
- **Dealing**: All 52 cards are dealt (26 per player).
- **Starting Player**: The player who receives the 7♣️ starts the game.
- **Table Piles**: Four suit piles (♣️, ♦️, ♥️, ♠️) are built on the table.

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of either playing a card or passing:

### Card Play

1. **Choosing a playable card**: The player selects a card that can be legally played.
2. **Placing on the table**: The card is moved to its suit's table pile.
3. **Turn alternation**: After playing a card, the turn switches to the other player.

### Pass Option (Pawn)

- **Unable to play**: If no cards are playable, the player must pass.
- **Pawn penalty**: In the 2-player game, passing requires taking one random card from the opponent's hand ("pawn" or "pantti").
- **Mandatory play**: A player cannot pass if any legal moves exist.
- **Turn alternation**: Passing switches the turn to the other player.

## Card Placement Rules

### Initial Play Requirements

- **7♣️ must start**: The 7 of clubs ♣️ must be the very first card played.
- **Opening other suits**: Once the 7♣️ is played, other 7s can be played to start their respective suit piles.

### Sequence Building Rules

#### Six Before Eight

- **The Rule**: A **6** of a suit must be played before an **8** of that same suit can be played.
- **Flow**: 7 → 6 → 8. Once 6 and 8 are down, the sequence can continue in both directions.

#### Extending Sequences

- **Descending**: From 6 down to 2 (6, 5, 4, 3, 2).
- **Ascending**: From 8 up to King (8, 9, 10, J, Q, K).
- **No gaps**: Sequences must be built without skipping ranks.

#### Ace as the Closer

- **Closing the suit**: An **Ace** can only be played once the entire rest of the suit (2 through King) is already on the table.
- **Final card**: The Ace is the last card for any suit pile.

## Game Flow

### Early Game

- **7♣ Start**: The holder of 7♣ makes the first move.
- **Unlocking suits**: Playing other 7s allows sequences to start in those suits.
- **Enabling 8s**: Playing a 6 is critical as it unlocks the ability to play the 8 and higher cards of that suit.

### Mid Game

- **Blocking**: Strategic players may hold onto 6s or 7s to prevent the opponent from playing their high or low cards.
- **Hand management**: Balancing between playing cards and forcing the opponent to pass.

### End Game

- **Victory**: The first player to empty their hand wins.
- **Immediate end**: The game ends as soon as one player plays their last card.

## Scoring

- **Winner**: The player who plays all their cards first is the winner.
- **2-Player**: No complex scoring is typically used in the basic 2-player version; it's a race to empty the hand.
