# Katko Rules

## Overview

Katko (also known as "Last Trick") is a traditional Finnish trick-taking game for 2 players, based on [rules on Wikipedia](<https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katko_(korttipeli)>). The goal is to win the very last trick of each hand. The first player to reach 3 points wins the game.

- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K in clubs ♣️, diamonds ♦️, hearts ♥️, spades ♠️).
- **Ranking**: Aces high (A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2).
- **Players**: 2 (Player 1 vs Player 2).
- **Deal**: 5 cards are dealt to each player. Each new hand is dealt from the **remaining cards** in the deck. The deck is only reshuffled once it is exhausted (fewer than 10 cards left).

## Gameplay

- **Leading**: The non-dealer leads the first trick of each hand.
- **Following Suit**: You must follow the suit led if you have a card of that suit.
- **Reneging**: If you cannot follow suit, you may play any card.
- **Winning a Trick**: The highest card of the led suit wins the trick. There are no trumps.
- The winner of a trick leads the next trick within the same hand.

## Scoring

- Play continues until all 5 cards are played (5 tricks).
- The player who wins the **last trick** (the 5th trick) earns **1 game point**.
- All other tricks are irrelevant for scoring.

## Winning the Game

- The first player to reach **3 game points** wins the match.
- The winner of the last trick becomes the **dealer** for the next hand.
- If the deck runs out before anyone reaches 3 points, all cards are gathered and reshuffled to continue the match.

## Game Strategy

- **Focus on the Last Trick**: Since only the 5th trick scores a point, all other tricks are merely setup.
- **Save High Cards**: Try to preserve your highest cards (Aces, Kings) for the final trick.
- **Force Opponent Plays**: Use lower cards to force your opponent to spend their high cards early.
- **Track Suits**: Remember which cards have been played. If the opponent is out of a suit, you might win the last trick with a lower card of that suit if you lead it.
