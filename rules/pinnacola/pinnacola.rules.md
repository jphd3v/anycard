## Overview

Pinnacola is a two-player game played with two standard 52-card decks including jokers (108 cards total), based on the [rules of Pinnacola](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinnacola). The objective is to be the first player to accumulate 1000 points. Points are scored by forming melds of runs or sets. The hand is concluded when a player goes out by discarding their last card, provided specific "Pinnacola" and "Poker" requirements have been satisfied.

## Setup

- **Players**: 2 players.
- **Dealing**: Each player is dealt 13 cards.
- **Discard Pile (Pozzo)**: The remaining cards form the deck, and the top card is flipped face-up to begin the pozzo.
- **Wild Cards**: Jokers are wild and may substitute for any rank.

## Turn Structure

Each turn is divided into three mandatory phases:

### Phase 1: The Draw

The turn is commenced by taking cards from one of two sources:

- **Draw from deck**: The top card is taken from the face-down pile.
- **Take the Pozzo**: The entire discard pile is taken into the hand. If this action is performed, the top card of the pile is required to be melded immediately.

### Phase 2: Melding

New melds may be placed on the table, or cards may be added to existing melds.

- **Joker Replacement**: A Joker in any meld (belonging to either player) is permitted to be replaced with the natural card it represents.
- **Constraint**: If a Joker is replaced, it is required to be utilized immediately in a different meld.

### Phase 3: The Discard

The turn is concluded by discarding exactly one card to the pozzo.

- **Going Out**: The last card in the hand is only permitted to be discarded if the player has melded at least one **Pinnacola** and one **Poker**. If these conditions are not met, at least one card is required to be retained for the discard.

## Melding Rules

- **Runs (Scala)**: 3+ cards of the same suit in sequence.
- **Sets (Tris)**: 3 cards of the same rank but different suits.
- **Poker**: 4 cards of the same rank (one of each suit).
- **Pinnacola**: A run of 7 or more cards of the same suit.
- **Pinnacolone**: A complete run from Ace to King (13+ cards).
- **Joker Limit**: Only one Joker is permitted per meld, except in the case of a "Poker of Jokers" (4 Jokers).

## Scoring

The hand score is calculated as: **(Points in melds + bonuses) − (Points remaining in hand)**.

### Card Values

- **Joker**: 25 pts
- **Ace**: 15 pts
- **King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6**: 10 pts each
- **5, 4, 3, 2**: 5 pts each

### Bonuses

- **Closing**: +100 pts.
- **Pinnacola (7+ run)**: The point value of all cards in the run is doubled.
- **Pinnacolone (13+ run)**: 600 pts.
- **Poker of Aces**: 120 pts.
- **Poker of 6 to King**: 80 pts.
- **Poker of 2 to 5**: 40 pts.
- **Poker of Jokers**: 600 pts.
- **Chiusura in mano**: Double points and a +200 bonus are awarded if the hand is closed on the player's first turn.

## Play Notes

- **Fulfilling Requirements**: If the discard pile is captured or a Joker is replaced, the mandatory melding of the top card or Joker is required to be completed before a discard can be made.
- **Arranging Melds**: Cards may be moved between the hand and the table during the melding phase. All melds are required to be valid (3+ cards and legal ranks/suits) before the turn is concluded.
- **Closing Conditions**: The presence of both a Pinnacola and a Poker is verified when the hand is emptied. If these are not present, the final discard is rejected.
